		           		<TD>Write a program that takes an int as an argument and returns a String object representing the binary representation of the integer.
		               		Given the argument 42, it should return "101010". <BR>

		               		Implement the program by calculating the binary representation manually, and also by using the functionality available in the Java class libraries.

			        <TD>Object Oriented Concepts : Product and Multiple Classes</TD>
					<TD>Write a program that has multiple classes starting with a product class. Also Computer, software and stereo classes that inherit the product class. Laptop and desktop classes inherit computer and also Home Theater and car stereo that inherit the Stereo class.<BR><BR>
						The program should allow you to enter a new product and saves it to the database. Each product is given a unique ID number based on the number of record in the file. On the details tab you can view each record in the file and see the details of each product and even modify the record.

			        <TD>Create a data type PhoneNumber.java that represents a US phone number. The constructor should take three string arguments, the area code (3 decimal digits), the exchange (3 decimal digits) and the extension (4 decimal digits).<BR><BR>
			        Include a toString method that prints out phone numbers of the form (800) 867-5309. Include a method so that p.equals(q) returns true if the phone numbers p and q are the same, and false otherwise.

				    <TD>Create a data type Student.java to represent students in an introductory computer science course. Each student record object is comprised of four instance variables representing the first name, last name, email address, and section number. Include a toString() method. <BR>
				     Also include a method less() to compare students by section.

                 		<TD>
                 		Write a program that sets up a String variable containing a paragraph of text of your choice. Extract the words from the text and sort them into alphabetical order. Display the sorted list of words. You could use a simple sorting method called the bubble sort. To sort an array into ascending order the process is as follows:<BR><BR>

                        a.	Starting with the first element in the array, compare successive elements (0 and 1, 1 and 2, 2 and 3, and so on).<BR><BR>

                        b.	If the first element of any pair is greater than the second, interchange the two elements.<BR><BR>

                        c.	Repeat the process for the whole array until no interchanges are necessary. The array elements will now be in ascending order.<BR><BR>

                         Write a program that will reverse the sequence of letters in each word of a chosen paragraph .
                         For instance, " To be or not to be "  Would become " oT eb ro ton ot eb" .

                      Write a class named PairExample, which aggregates two arbitrary objects. Implement the equals() and hashCode() methods in such a way that a PairExample object is identical to another PairExample object if, and only if, the pair of constituent objects are identical.<BR><BR>
                      Make the toString() implementation return the textual representation of both the constituent objects in a PairExample object. <BR>

						Write two  anonymous inner class , one that implements an interface to sort the employees as per their DOB and
                        another anonymous inner class that extends a class to sort the employees as per their salary .<BR>

                      Write a method that takes a string and returns the number of unique characters in the string. <BR>

                      Pass a string with the same character sequence several times to the method. The counting operation is time consuming so the method should cache the results, so that when the method is given a string previously encountered, it will simply retrieve the stored result.<BR>

                      Use collections and maps where appropriate.<BR>
